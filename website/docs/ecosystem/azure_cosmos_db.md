[Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) is a fully managed [NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distributed-nosql), [relational](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distributed-relational), and [vector database](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/vector-database). It offers single-digit millisecond response times, automatic and instant scalability, along with guaranteed speed at any scale. Your business continuity is assured with up to 99.999% availability backed by [SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/cosmos-db).

Your can simplify your application development by using this single database service for all your operational data needs, from [geo-replicated distributed cache](https://medium.com/@marcodesanctis2/using-azure-cosmos-db-as-your-persistent-geo-replicated-distributed-cache-b381ad80f8a0) to backup to [vector database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/vector-database).

You can see how this is done within AutoGen:
